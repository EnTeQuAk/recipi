`Weight` table per 100g of food
The following formula is used to calculate the nutrient
content per household measure:
N = (V*W)/100

where:
N = nutrient value per household measure,
V = nutrient value per 100 g (Nutr_Val in the Nutrient Data file), and
W = g weight of portion (Gm_Wgt in the Weight file).
